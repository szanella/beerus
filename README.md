## Beerus

Solution to a Front end test for candidates applying for [Moku](https://moku.io/). This project consumes the [Brewdog open API](https://punkapi.com/).

Credits to [Marco](http://marcomezzavilla.com/) for the awesome design.

This solution is implemented as a React Single Page Application, using Redux for state management.
The layout is responsive and optimised for several common resolutions.

A demo can be found [here](https://beerus-995b7.firebaseapp.com).

If you're a candidate taking the test and you randomly stumbled upon this repo, don't cheat, chances are I'll be the one correcting your submission.
